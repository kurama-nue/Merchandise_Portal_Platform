# Security Checklist for Merchandise Portal Platform

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Helmet Security Headers
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/helmet.middleware.ts`
- **Description**: Helmet helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy: Prevents XSS attacks
  - X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: Controls DNS prefetching
  - Expect-CT: Certificate Transparency
  - X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking
  - X-Powered-By: Removes X-Powered-By header
  - HSTS: HTTP Strict Transport Security
  - X-Download-Options: Prevents IE from executing downloads
  - X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME-sniffing
  - Referrer-Policy: Controls the Referer header
  - X-XSS-Protection: Provides XSS protection in older browsers
  - Cross-Origin-*: Controls cross-origin policies

### 2. CORS with Allowlist Configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/cors.middleware.ts`
- **Description**: Restricts which domains can access the API:
  - Whitelist approach for allowed origins
  - Credentials support for authenticated requests
  - Preflight request caching
  - Controlled headers exposure

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/rate-limit.middleware.ts`
- **Description**: Prevents abuse of the API:
  - General API rate limiter: 100 requests per 15 minutes
  - Authentication routes limiter: 10 requests per hour
  - Sensitive operations limiter: 5 requests per hour
  - Custom rate limiter factory for specific routes

### 4. JWT Authentication
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`
- **Description**: Secure authentication mechanism:
  - Support for both Bearer token and HttpOnly cookie authentication
  - Token verification and user retrieval
  - Role-based authorization
  - Secure cookie configuration with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags

### 5. CSRF Protection
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/csrf.middleware.ts`
- **Description**: Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks:
  - Token generation and validation
  - Protection for state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Integration with cookie-based authentication

### 6. Bcrypt Password Hashing
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/bcrypt.middleware.ts`
- **Description**: Secure password storage:
  - 12 rounds of salt generation (industry recommended)
  - Standardized hashing and comparison functions

### 7. Zod Validation
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/validation.middleware.ts`
- **Description**: Input validation and sanitization:
  - Schema-based validation for request body, query, and params
  - Detailed error reporting
  - Type safety and data integrity

### 8. HTTPS-Only in Production
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/https.middleware.ts`
- **Description**: Ensures secure communication:
  - Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS in production
  - Checks for secure connection via req.secure or x-forwarded-proto header

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times
- ✅ HttpOnly cookies for token storage
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Secure password storage with bcrypt (12 rounds)

### Data Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Input validation with Zod
- ✅ Content-Type validation
- ✅ Schema-based validation for all inputs

### Protection Against Common Attacks
- ✅ XSS protection via CSP headers
- ✅ CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- ✅ SQL Injection protection via MongoDB/Mongoose
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- ✅ Clickjacking protection via X-Frame-Options

### Transport Security
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement in production
- ✅ HSTS headers
- ✅ Secure cookie configuration

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Security Monitoring and Logging**
   - Implement centralized logging for security events
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Consider using a SIEM solution

2. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Conduct periodic code reviews focused on security
   - Run automated security scanning tools
   - Consider penetration testing

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use tools like npm audit to check for vulnerabilities
   - Consider implementing a dependency scanning tool in CI/CD

4. **Additional Security Measures**
   - Implement API key management for external services
   - Consider adding two-factor authentication
   - Implement IP-based blocking for repeated failed login attempts

## Testing Security Implementations

To verify the security implementations, follow these steps:

1. **Helmet Headers Testing**
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect response headers
   - Verify all security headers are present and correctly configured

2. **CORS Testing**
   - Test API access from allowed origins
   - Verify requests from unauthorized origins are blocked

3. **Rate Limiting Testing**
   - Send multiple requests in quick succession
   - Verify rate limit headers are present
   - Confirm requests are blocked after limit is reached

4. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test both cookie and bearer token authentication
   - Verify expired tokens are rejected
   - Test role-based access control

5. **CSRF Protection Testing**
   - Attempt state-changing requests without CSRF token
   - Verify requests are blocked

6. **HTTPS Enforcement Testing**
   - In production, attempt HTTP requests
   - Verify redirection to HTTPS

## Conclusion

The Merchandise Portal Platform has implemented comprehensive security measures following industry best practices. Regular reviews and updates to these security measures are recommended to maintain a strong security posture as the application evolves.
